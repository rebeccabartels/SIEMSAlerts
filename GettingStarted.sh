## SIEMs Day 2: Guided Practice - Using Alerts to Monitor System Files
--------
​
### Instructions
​
In this Guided Practice you will create a search that monitors errors in the internal Splunk log at `/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log` and create an alert.
​
#### Getting Started
​
1. Set Splunk to monitor the file `/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log`
​
2. Save the host as `splunk-alerts`. 
​
3. Enter the following search in the Search window:
​
    ```bash
    host=splunk-alerts action=login status=failure
    ```
    
    * Set the Search Period to `All Time`.
​
    * Click the search icon to run the search.
    
4. Set the Search Period to `All Time`.
​
5. Click the search icon to run the search.
​
#### Saving as Alert
​
Now save the search as an alert.
​
1. Select `Alert` from the `Save As` drop down list. 
​
2. Use the following values to populate the fields:
​
    * `Title` as **Error log from splunkd.log**
​
    *  `Permissions` as **Shared in App**
​
    *  `Alert type` as **Real-time**
​
    * `Trigger alert when` as **Per Result**
​
    * `Add Action` as **Add to Triggered Alerts**  and select **Info** 
​
3. Click **Save**.  
​
​
 #### Triggering a Failed Login Attempt Alert
​
Trigger a failed login attempt by logging into Splunk with an incorrect username and password (twice).   
​
#### View the Alerts in the Triggered Alert List
​
1. View alerts from the **Alert Menu**.
​
2. View alerts from the **Activity** drop down list.
