## Warm-Up Activity: Investigating Locked Accounts using the Contingency Command
​
### Instructions
​
Welcome to the Warm-up Activity!  
​
In a previous exercise, your task was to monitor a web application that allowed customers to purchase your company's products. You are concerned that there is a threat of an attacker attempting to **brute force login** to your application. 
​
Your search discovered that the Windows event log showed **57 failed login** attempts occurred in one minute. Using this data, you developed a `baseline` and `threshold` for creating alerts for `failed login attempts` to the web application.  
​
Your next task is to investigate the **target of the activity** by looking at the `account names` and `account domains` for failed login attempts in the Windows event log.
In this activity, you will be introduced to a new SPL command that will help you with the investigation.
 
- The syntax for the command is: `contingency <field><field>` 
​
   - `contingency` is the Splunk command
​
   - `field` is a field in the event
​
  [Documentation](<https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.5/SearchReference/Contingency>) is available for the command at the Splunk website.
​
#### 1. Getting Started
​
* Log into Splunk using your `username` and `password`.
​
* Upload the `wineventlogs_baseline.csv` file into Splunk.
​
#### 2. Execute a search for locked accounts
​
* Write a SPL command that will search for locked accounts.
​
#### 3. Investigate the target of the activity
​
* Wite a `contingency search` command that will display the relationship between `account names` and `account domains`.  This will narrow down the targets for the failed login attempts.
​
   * Hint: `pipe` this command to your first command.
​
#### 4. Develop your conclusion
​
* Answer the following question:
​
   * Where was the attacker trying to gain access?
​
Great job.  Activity Complete!
​
#### Additional Challenge 
​
* Using the `access_30DAY.log` file, provide another example of when a `contingency table` can be used, such as **User agent and status** analysis
